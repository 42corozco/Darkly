# Unvalidated redirects

## Page

* Url: http://192.168.56.101/

## Exploitation

* Changing the value associated with the 'site' key

I changed the redirection url of the Instagram icon to redirect to another site and it gave me the flag

![?????](./Resources/1-exploit.png)

![?????](./Resources/2-flag.png)

## Weaknesses

The web application accepts untrusted input causing a redirection to potentially untrusted URL. By modifying the target of the redirection, a malicious actor can launch a phishing scam or steal user credentials.

![Links to social accounts] (./Resources/social_icons.png)

In this case, the intended behaviour is that each icon should redirect to the relevant social account. When a icon is clicked, the following vulnerable code is executed:

```
index.php?page=redirect&site=instagram
```

## Solution

* **Validating URLs**: the redirection url should be validated to make sure it is safe. Alternatively, the user input could be checked against a whitelist.
