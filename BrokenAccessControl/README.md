# Broken Access Control

## Enumeration

When inspecting the cookies stored from this website, we find a cookie named "I_am_admin"

![Presence of a "I am admin" cookie](./Resources/1-cookies.png)

The cookie's value is ciphered using MD5.

![MD5 ciphering](./Resources/2-cipher_identifier.png)

We know that MD5 is an outdated encryption algorithm and that weak hashes can be decrypted.

We tried to see if the hash is known to the database

## Exploitation

* We encrypt the value "true" using MD5 algorithm

![Encrypting our payload](./Resources/4-Crypter-true.png)

* We change replace the old value with our new payload and refresh the site

## Weaknesses

* **Cryptographic failure**: MD5 is an outdated cryptographic algorithm and should not be to encrypt sensitive data.

* **Identification and Authentication failures**: The server does not verify if the user is in fact admin. The value of the cookie is too predictable and can be manipulated. 

## Solution

* Design admin privileges without tokens but with admin user instead and verify its identity at server side. The activity of the admin user should also be logged.

* If a token must be used for admin privilege than its value should be random to not be manipulated, and the token's lifetime should be short.

* Replace MD5 for hard cryptographic algorithm.
