Submitting the form we get the following page.

![?????](./Resources/2-ResDefaultMail.png)


## Exploitation

* Change the email address to redirect to another one we own

![?????](./Resources/3-ChangeMail.png)

We get the flag:

![?????](./Resources/4-ResChangeMail.png).

## Weaknesses

* **Trusting client-side data**: The reset password strategy should no integrate client-side data. Instead, the back-end should verify that the email actually exist in their database.

## Solution

* Check against the database that the email address exist.
